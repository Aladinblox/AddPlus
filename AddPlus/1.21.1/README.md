# AddPlus for Minecraft 1.21.1

This directory is a placeholder for the Minecraft 1.21.1 specific implementation of the AddPlus plugin.

The core logic for item management, commands, and GUI is developed primarily in the 1.21 module. Future work for this version would involve:
1. Setting up a specific Paper/Spigot API dependency for 1.21.1.
2. Implementing any necessary version-specific handlers or API adaptations.
3. Utilizing the shared core components for item definitions, registry, and command processing.
4. Compiling and testing specifically for Minecraft 1.21.1.

Currently, only the 1.21 version is actively developed.
